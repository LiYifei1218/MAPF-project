# Multi-Agent Path Finding Project
This is a implementation for the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) by Sven Koenig.
The implementation contains a single agent, space-time A* solver, and parts of three MAPF solvers, namely prioritized planning, Conï¬‚ict-Based Search (CBS), and CBS with disjoint splitting.
